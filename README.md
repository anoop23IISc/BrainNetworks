# Brain Networks

An ongoing project -  aim is to model human brain as a complex network, do graph analysis on it and develop insights from the results.

1. Modelled human brain as a network using fMRI data, to detect Alzheimer.
2. Built a Hierarchical GCN based model, achieved 83% accuracy on ADNI data, beats kernel-based methods.
3. Working on scalable multiplex embedding techniques to incorporate multi-task fMRI.
